# hello-world

Hi, Github developer!

Alicia here, I like tring new things,especially those tools which can achieve something amazing!
I don't afraid of difficulties. Everything has two sides ,right?and I always tell myself to see the bright side. My mom taught me that as long as I tried my best ,no pity would be left.

That's the reason why I start my python journey!
I believe I can acquire this greatful skill.
I can hardly wait to use it to achieve more.
I have two years to devote myself into it.

yes, fun will be the initial as well as lasting power!
Can you feel my passion?
of course , you can!   hahahahhaha~~~
